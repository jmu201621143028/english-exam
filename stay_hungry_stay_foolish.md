I am one of the finest be with you today at your commencement from
universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is
the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three
muibs12
20
stories from my life.


The first story is about connecting the dots.


I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as
a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?


At the age of 17, I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as
Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my
college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea
what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me
figure it out. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It
was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I
voever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that
didn't interest me, and began dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.


It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in
friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 ¢ deposits to buy food with, and
I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a
week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into
by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me
give you one example.


Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the
20wcountry. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was
uo beautifully hand calligraphed. I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to
do this. I learned about serif and sanserif typefaces, about varying the amount of
space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography
great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't
laedcapture, and I found it fascinating.s 

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years
orlater,when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to
me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful
vhstypography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac
ym would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. s


Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in
college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. So you
br have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust
in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has
mo never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

My second story is about love and loss.

I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple
ai to in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple
had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with
over 4, 000 employees. We had just released our finest creation - the
Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How
can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired
someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for
the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to
diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of
Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had
been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.


I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous
2w generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was
being passed to me. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about
running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me - I
still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.

I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best
thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful
o was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about
in everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.


During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT4, another company
named Pixar³, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my
nt wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film,
Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a
120 remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple. And
Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.


I'm pretty sure none of these would have happened if I hadn't been fired from
Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but the patient needed it. Sometimes life
hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. The only thing that kept me
going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is
iw as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large
part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe
woffis great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you
haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.в m

My third story is about death. ot botnaтв


When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day
as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an
awo impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the
bae mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life,
Srkwould I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has
been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever
Sial encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything
sball external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -these
if ofthings just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
bm Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap
of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no
ereason not to follow your heart.


About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7: 30 in the
morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. The doctors told me
this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should
expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go
home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for "prepare to die". I
lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy. I was
sedated. It turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable
with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now.


his was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for
a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a
onbit more certainty that death was a useful but purely intellectual concept.


No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to
get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever
escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single
best invention of life. It is life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way
for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,
you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. sw I nsrlW e


Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be
trapped by dogma. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own
inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and
ad intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
Everything else is secondary.

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth
a Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. This was in the late
1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made
with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in
paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and
overflowing with neat tools and great notions.



Then when it had run its course, a final issue was put out. On the back cover of
their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road. Beneath it
were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was the farewell message.
bl And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin
anew, I wish that for you.

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
Thank you all very much.
