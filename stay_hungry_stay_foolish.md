I am one of the finest be with you today at your commencement from universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life.  
今天，我很荣幸能与各位一同参加这所世界顶尖大学的毕业典礼。我从未从大学毕业。说实话，此刻是我离大学毕业最近的一刻。今天，我想分享我人生中的三个故事。


The first story is about connecting the dots.  
第一个故事——关于串联点滴


I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?  
我在里德学院读了六个月后就退学了，但之后仍作为旁听生逗留了大约十八个月才真正离开。那么，我为什么要退学呢？



At the age of 17, I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I voever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and began dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.  
十七岁时，我天真地选择了一所几乎和斯坦福一样昂贵的大学，而我工薪阶层父母的积蓄几乎都花在了我的学费上。六个月后，我看不到上学的价值。我不知道自己想做什么人生，也不知道大学如何能帮我找到答案。于是我决定退学，并相信一切都会好起来。当时这决定很可怕，但现在回想起来，这是我做过最好的决定之一。退学后，我不用再去上那些我不感兴趣的必修课，而是开始旁听那些看起来有趣的课程。


It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 ¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example.  
但这并不浪漫。我没有宿舍，只能睡在朋友房间的地板上；我靠退可乐瓶换五分钱押金买吃的；每周日晚上，我会步行七英里穿过城区，去克利须那神庙吃一顿像样的晚餐。但我乐在其中。许多我凭着好奇与直觉偶然踏入的领域，后来都被证明是无价之宝。让我举个例子。


Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sanserif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't laedcapture, and I found it fascinating.  
当时，里德学院拥有可能是全国最好的书法课。校园里每张海报、每个抽屉的标签都是优美的手写体。我决定选修书法课，学习这门艺术。我学会了衬线字体和无衬线字体，如何调整字母间距，以及是什么让版式设计如此出色。书法优美、富有历史感，艺术精妙之处是科学无法捕捉的，我深深着迷。


None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years orlater,when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful vhstypography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.  
当时我完全没想过这些知识能有什么实际应用。但十年后，当我们设计第一台麦金塔电脑时，这一切突然重现脑海。我们将书法设计全部融入麦金塔中，它因此成为第一台拥有精美版式的电脑。如果当年我没有旁听那门课，麦金塔可能就不会有多种字体和比例匀称的间距。


Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later. So you br have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.  
当然，在大学时，我无法预见这些点滴如何串联。但十年后回顾，一切清晰无比。所以你们必须相信，点滴终将在未来以某种方式串联。你们必须相信某些东西——直觉、命运、生命、因果，什么都好。这种方式从未让我失望，它改变了我的人生。


My second story is about love and loss.  
第二个故事——关于热爱与失去。


I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4, 000 employees. We had just released our finest creation - the Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.  
我很幸运——在人生早期就找到了热爱的事。二十岁时，沃兹和我在父母的车库里创办了苹果公司。我们非常努力，十年间，苹果从车库里的两人成长为拥有四千名员工、价值二十亿美元的公司。我们刚刚发布了最棒的产品——麦金塔电脑，而我也刚满三十岁。然后，我被解雇了。自己创立的公司怎么会解雇自己？原来，随着苹果壮大，我们聘请了一位我认为很有才华的人和我一起管理公司。起初一切顺利，但后来我们对未来的愿景出现分歧，最终闹翻了。董事会站在了他那边。于是，三十岁的我出局了，而且非常公开地出局了。我成年后所有生活的重心突然消失，这对我打击巨大。



I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me - I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.  
随后的几个月，我不知所措。我觉得自己让上一代创业者失望了——仿佛接力棒传到我手中时，我却弄掉了它。我成了公众眼中的失败者，甚至想过逃离硅谷。但渐渐地，我开始明白——我仍然热爱我所做的一切。苹果的变故丝毫没有改变这一点。我被否定了，但我依然热爱。于是我决定重新开始。


I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.  
当时我不明白，但后来发现，被苹果解雇是我人生中最好的事。成功的沉重被初学者的轻松取代，对一切不再那么确定。这让我自由地进入了人生中最富创造力的阶段之一。



During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT4, another company named Pixar³, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.  
在接下来的五年里，我创立了NeXT公司，又创立了皮克斯公司，并爱上了一位出色的女性，她后来成了我的妻子。皮克斯制作了世界上第一部电脑动画长片《玩具总动员》，如今已成为全球最成功的动画工作室。在一次惊人的转折中，苹果收购了NeXT，我因此重返苹果。而劳伦和我组成了美好的家庭。


I'm pretty sure none of these would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. The only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe woffis great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.  
我确信，如果我没有被苹果解雇，这一切都不会发生。这剂药很苦，但病人需要它。有时，生活会给你当头一棒。但不要失去信念。支撑我走下去的唯一动力，就是我爱我所做的一切。你们必须找到自己热爱的事物。这适用于工作，也适用于爱情。工作将占据人生大部分时间，而唯有相信自己做的是伟大的工作，才能真正满足。而成就伟大事业的唯一途径，就是热爱自己的事业。如果你们还没找到，请继续寻找。不要将就。


My third story is about death.  
第三个故事——关于死亡。


When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, Srkwould I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.  
十七岁时，我读到一句话：“如果你把每一天都当作生命中的最后一天，那么有一天你肯定是对的。”这句话深深触动了我。从那以后的三十三年里，我每天早晨都会对着镜子问自己：“如果今天是我生命的最后一天，我还会去做今天计划要做的事吗？”如果连续多天的答案都是“不”，我就知道需要改变。


Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -these if ofthings just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.  
记住“我即将死去”，是我一生中最重要的工具，帮助我做出人生的重大选择。因为几乎所有的一切——外界的期望、骄傲、对尴尬或失败的恐惧——在死亡面前都会消散，只留下真正重要的东西。记住你终将死去，是避免患得患失的最好方法。你本就一无所有，没有理由不追随内心。


About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7: 30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for "prepare to die". I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy. I was sedated. It turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now.  
大约一年前，我被诊断出癌症。早上七点半的扫描显示我胰腺上有一个肿瘤。医生告诉我，这几乎是不治之症，我最多只能活三到六个月。医生建议我回家把一切安排妥当，这是“准备后事”的委婉说法。我整天带着这个诊断结果。当晚晚些时候，我做了活检，打了镇静剂。后来发现这是一种非常罕见的、可通过手术治愈的胰腺癌。我接受了手术，现在痊愈了。


This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty that death was a useful but purely intellectual concept.  
这是我离死亡最近的一次，我也希望未来几十年内别再这么近了。经历过这一切后，我现在可以更肯定地告诉你们：死亡曾是一个有用但抽象的概念。


No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.  
没有人想死。即使是想上天堂的人，也不想为此而死。但死亡是我们共同的终点，无人能逃脱。这也理所应当，因为死亡很可能是生命最伟大的发明。它是生命的变革推动者，推陈出新。现在的新生代是你们，但在不久的将来，你们也会逐渐变老，被生命的新陈代谢所取代。


Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.  
你们的时间有限，不要浪费在重复他人的生活上。不要被教条束缚，不要被他人的噪音淹没内心的声音。最重要的是，要有勇气追随自己的内心和直觉。它们早已知道你真正想成为什么。其他的一切都是次要的。


When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.  
我年轻时，有一本出色的刊物叫《全球概览》，它是我们那代人的“圣经”之一。那是在1960年代末，个人电脑和桌面出版尚未出现，所以它全靠打字机、剪刀和宝丽来相机完成。它有点像平装版的谷歌，比谷歌诞生早了三十五年：它充满理想主义，汇聚了各种巧妙的工具和伟大的理念。


Then when it had run its course, a final issue was put out. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road. Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was the farewell message. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.  
当它完成使命时，团队出版了最后一期。封底是一张清晨乡村公路的照片，下方写着：“求知若饥，虚心若愚。”这是他们的告别赠言。我一直以此自勉。现在，在你们毕业开启新旅程之际，我也将此赠予你们。


Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
Thank you all very much.  
求知若饥，虚心若愚。
非常感谢大家。
