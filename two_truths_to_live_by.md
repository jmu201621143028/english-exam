The art of living is to know when to hold fast and when to let go. For life is a
paradox: it enjoins us to cling to its many gifts even while it ordains their
eventual relinquishment. The rabbis³ of old put it this way: "A man comes to
this world with his fist clenched, but when he dies, his hand is open." We begin
by grasping, ultimately we must renounce.
生活的艺术，在于懂得什么时候该紧紧抓住，什么时候又该学会放手。
因为人生本身就是一个悖论：它一方面要求我们珍惜、把握生命赐予的诸多恩惠，另一方面却又注定我们终将失去它们。
古代的拉比曾这样说：“人来到这个世界时，拳头是紧握的；而当他离开时，手却是张开的。”
我们以抓取开始，却必须以放下结束。


Surely we ought to hold fast to life, for it is wondrous, and full of a beauty that
breaks through every pore of God's own earth. We know that this is so, but all
too often we recognize this truth only in our backward glance when we remember
what it was and then suddenly realize that it is no more.
毫无疑问，我们应当珍惜生命，因为它奇妙非凡，充满了美——那种从上帝大地的每一个毛孔中迸发出来的美。
我们心里明白这一点，但太多时候，只有在回首往事时，我们才意识到这一真理：当我们想起曾经拥有的一切，才突然发现，它已经不复存在。


We remember a beauty that faded, a love that waned. But we remember with far
greater pain that we did not see that beauty when it flowered, that we failed to
respond with love when it was tendered.
我们记得那些已经褪色的美，记得那逐渐消散的爱。
但更令人痛苦的是，我们记得自己当初并没有看见美正在盛放，也没有在爱被给予时，以爱去回应。


A recent experience re-taught me this truth. I was hospitalized following a severe
heart attack and had been in intensive care for several days. It was not a pleasant
place. My own pains and fears aside, its noises were not restful to the ear: The
running feet of doctors and nurses, and moans and groans and cries of pain and on
two occasions during those days the dances and the rattling of death, and then the
weeping of the suddenly bereaved.
最近的一次经历再次教会了我这个道理。
我因一次严重的心脏病发作住进了医院，在重症监护室待了好几天。那并不是一个令人愉快的地方。
除了我自身的痛苦与恐惧之外，那里的声音也让人无法安宁：医生和护士匆忙的脚步声，呻吟、哀号、痛苦的呼喊声；而在那几天中，有两次，我亲眼目睹了死亡的挣扎与颤响，随后便是突然失去亲人的痛哭。


One morning, I had to have some additional tests. The required machines were
located in a building at the opposite end of the hospital, so I had to be wheeled
across the courtyard on a gurney.
一天早上，我需要做一些额外的检查。
相关设备在医院另一端的楼里，于是我被放在担架床上，穿过庭院推了过去。


As we emerged from our unit, the sunlight hit me. That's all there was to my
experience. Just the light of the sun, and yet how beautiful it was - how
warming, how sparkling, how brilliant!
当我们走出病区时，阳光照在了我身上。
那就是我全部的体验——仅仅是阳光而已。
然而，它是那样美丽：温暖、闪耀、明亮夺目。


I looked to see whether anyone else relished the sun's golden glow, but everyone
was hurrying to and fro, most with eyes fixed on the ground. Then I remembered
how often I, too, had been indifferent to the grandeur of each day, too
preoccupied with petty and sometimes even mean concerns to respond to the
splendor of it all.
我环顾四周，想看看是否还有别人也在享受这金色的阳光，但人们都在匆匆来去，大多低着头。
这时我想起，自己曾多少次对每日的壮丽景象漠然以对——被琐碎、甚至狭隘的事情占据了心神，而无法回应这一切的辉煌。


The insight gleaned from that experience is really as commonplace as was the
experience itself: Life's gifts are precious- but we are too heedless of them.
Thornton Wilder makes this point in one of his magnificent creations, his
immortal Our Town. In this play, a young woman who died in childbirth is
allowed to return to earth for just one day. She chooses her sixteenth birthday as
the day she would like to re-live. But as she comes upon the scene so familiar to
her she finds that everyone is far too busy to relish the day's wonder. Even her
parents pay no attention to her, thus she asks to go where she belongs.
从那次经历中得到的感悟，其实和那次经历本身一样平凡：
生命的馈赠是珍贵的——但我们却常常对此毫无察觉。
桑顿·怀尔德在他不朽的作品《我们的小镇》中深刻表达了这一点。
剧中，一位死于分娩的年轻女子被允许重返人间一天。她选择重温自己十六岁的生日。
然而，当她回到那个熟悉的场景时，却发现所有人都忙得无暇欣赏这一天的奇妙。甚至连她的父母也没有注意到她。于是，她请求回到自己本该去的地方。


Is not this the malady that afflicts us? We are blind, blind to so much of the
beauty which abounds in our world. We walk about in a cloud of ignorance. We
trample on the feelings of those who love us. We spend and waste time as though
we had a million years to live always at the mercy of one self-centered passion
51 after another. How heedless we often are of our good until it is too late. Like
birds whose beauty is concealed until their plumes are spread against the sky, our
blessings brighten only as they take their flight.
这不正是折磨我们的通病吗？
我们是盲目的——对世界中无处不在的美视而不见。
我们在无知的迷雾中行走，践踏那些爱我们之人的感受。
我们挥霍时间，仿佛自己能活上百万年，一次又一次被自我中心的欲望牵着走。
我们常常在一切都为时已晚时，才意识到曾经拥有的美好。
就像某些鸟类，只有在展翅飞向天空时，羽毛的美才显现出来——我们的祝福，也往往在失去时才真正闪耀。


Here then is the first pole of life's paradoxical demands on us: Never be too busy
er for the wonder and the awe of life. Be reverent before each dawning day.
Embrace each hour. Seize each golden minute.
这便是人生悖论的第一极：
永远不要忙到无暇感受生命的奇妙与敬畏。
对每一个黎明心怀虔敬，拥抱每一个小时，抓住每一个金色的瞬间。


Hold fast to life... but not so fast that you cannot let go. This is the second side
of life's coin, the opposite pole of its paradox: We must accept our losses, and
learn how to let go.
紧紧抓住生命——
但不要抓得太紧，以至于无法放手。
这便是人生之币的另一面，是悖论的对立一极：
我们必须学会接受失去，并学会放下。


This is not an easy lesson to learn, especially when we are young and think that
the world is ours to command, that whatever we desire with the full force of our
passionate being can, nay, will be ours. But then life moves along to confront
yous with realities, and slowly but surely this second truth dawns upon us.
这并不是一堂容易学会的课，尤其是在年轻时。
那时我们以为世界尽在掌控，只要用尽全部激情去渴望，想要的一切就一定会属于我们。
但人生终会向前推进，把现实摆在我们面前，慢慢地、却不可避免地，这第二个真理便会显现。


At every stage of life we sustain losses - and grow in the process. We begin our
independent lives only when we emerge from the womb and lose its protective
shelter. We enter a progression of schools, then we leave our mothers and
fathers and our childhood homes. We get married and have children and then
have to let them go. We confront the death of our parents and our spouses. We
face the gradual or not so gradual waning of our own strength. And ultimately,
as the parable of the open and closed hand suggests, we must confront the
inevitability of our own demise, losing ourselves as it were, all that we were or
dreamed to be.
在人生的每一个阶段，我们都会经历失去——也在这个过程中成长。
我们只有在离开母体、失去它的庇护时，才开始独立的人生。
我们进入不同的学校，又离开父母和童年的家。
我们结婚、生子，然后又不得不放手让他们离开。
我们面对父母与配偶的离世，面对自身力量的逐渐衰退。
最终，正如“张开的手与紧握的拳头”的寓言所暗示的那样，我们必须直面自身死亡的必然性——仿佛连“自我”本身，也一并失去。



When Rabbi Bunam³, renowned Chassidic master, was lying on his death bed,
his wife wept bitterly, whereupon he reproached her saying: Don't you know
that life is given to us merely that we might learn how to die? Life is the great
teacher in the art of renunciation. To heed this truth is not only just and right. It
is the very gate of wisdom. Our parable of the open and closed hand confronts us
with life's contrary demands: First we were enjoined to cling to life, to
appreciate its every gift. Then we are told to learn how to renounce these gifts.
当著名的哈西德派大师布南拉比躺在临终床上时，他的妻子悲痛欲绝。
他责备她说：“难道你不知道吗？生命被赐予我们，只是为了让我们学会如何死亡。”
生命是教会我们放下的伟大导师。
理解这一真理，不仅合乎正义，也通向智慧之门。
“张开的手与紧握的拳头”的寓言，正向我们揭示了生命相互矛盾的要求：
先是教我们珍惜生命、感恩每一份馈赠；随后，又教我们学会舍弃这些馈赠。


But why should we be reconciled to life's contradictory demands? Why fashion
things of beauty when beauty is evanescent? Why give our heart in love when
those we love will ultimately be torn from our grasp?
In order to resolve this paradox, we must seek a wider perspective, viewing our
lives as through windows that open on eternity. Once we do that, we realize that
though our lives are finite, our deeds on earth weave a timeless pattern.
但我们为何要接受生命这种矛盾的要求？
既然美终将消逝，为什么还要创造美？
既然所爱之人终会被夺走，为什么还要付出真心？
要解开这一悖论，我们必须站在更宽广的视角，从通向永恒的窗口来看待人生。
当我们这样看时，便会明白：尽管生命有限，但我们在世上的行为却编织出永恒的图案。


Life is never just being. It is a becoming, a relentless flowing on. Our parents
live on through us, and we will live on through our children. The institutions we
build endure, and we will endure through them. The beauty we fashion cannot
be dimmed by death. Our flesh may perish, our hands will wither, but that
which they create in beauty and goodness and truth lives on for all time to come.
生命从来不仅仅是“存在”，而是“生成”，是一种不停向前的流动。
父母通过我们继续活着，我们也通过子女延续生命。
我们建立的制度得以延续，我们也借此得以长存。
我们创造的美不会因死亡而黯淡。
肉体或许会消亡，双手终将枯萎，但它们所创造的美、善与真，却将永存。


When Chanayo Ben Teradyon, noblest of Jewish martyrs, was burned at the
stake wrapped in a scroll of the Law, his pupils who witnessed his terrible agony
cried out: "Our master, our teacher, what seest thou?" He replied: "I see the
avi parchment burning, but the letters of the Law, they soar on high. "
当犹太殉道者查纳约·本·特拉迪翁被裹在《律法书》中活活烧死时，他的弟子们悲痛地问：“老师，您看见了什么？”
他回答说：“我看见羊皮在燃烧，但律法的文字，正在高空飞翔。”

Don't spend and waste your lives accumulating objects that will only turn to dust
nert and ashes. Pursue not so much the material as the ideal, for ideals alone invest
life with meaning and are of enduring worth.
不要把生命耗费在积累终将化为尘土与灰烬的物品上。
不要只追逐物质，而要追求理想。
唯有理想，才能赋予生命意义，并具有永恒的价值。


Add love to a house and you have a home. Add righteousness to a city and you
have a community. Add truth to a pile of red brick and you have a school. Add
religion to the humblest of edifices and you have a sanctuary. Add justice to the
far-flung round of human endeavor and you have civilization. Put them all
together, exalt them above their present imperfections, add to them the vision of
humankind redeemed, forever free of need and strife and you have a future
lighted with the radiant colors of hope.
为房屋注入爱，它便成为家；
为城市注入正义，它便成为共同体；
为一堆红砖注入真理，它便成为学校；
为最朴素的建筑注入信仰，它便成为圣所；
为人类广阔的事业注入公正，它便成为文明。
将这一切汇聚起来，超越当下的不完美，再加上一个人类得以救赎、永远摆脱匮乏与纷争的愿景——
你便拥有了一个被希望的光辉照亮的未来。
