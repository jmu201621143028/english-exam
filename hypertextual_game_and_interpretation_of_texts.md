Grammars, dictionaries and encyclopaedias are systems: By using them you can produce all the texts you like. But a text itself is not a linguistic or an encyclopaedic system. A given text reduces the infinite or indefinite possibilities of a system to make up a closed universe. If I utter the sentence, "This morning I had for breakfast..." for example, the dictionary allows me to list many possible items, provided they are all organic. But if I definitely produce my text and utter, "This morning I had for breakfast bread and butter," then I have excluded cheese, caviar, pastrami and apples. A text excludes the infinite possibilities of a system. The Arabian Nights can be interpreted in many, many ways, but the story takes place in the Middle East and not in Italy, and it tells, let us say, of the deeds of Ali Baba or of Scheherazade and does not concern a captain determined to capture a white whale or a Tuscan poet visiting Hell, Purgatory and Paradise.  
语法、词典与百科全书都是系统：通过它们，你可以生成任意文本。但文本本身并非语言或知识的系统。特定文本将系统无限的可能性缩减为一个封闭的宇宙。例如，若我说出"今天早餐我吃了……"这个句子，词典允许我列举无数符合"有机物"定义的选项。但若我最终生成文本："今天早餐我吃了面包和黄油"，我便排除了奶酪、鱼子酱、熏牛肉和苹果。文本排除了系统的无限可能。《一千零一夜》可以有无数解读方式，但故事发生在中东而非意大利；它讲述的是阿里巴巴或山鲁佐德的事迹，而非一位船长追捕白鲸，或一位托斯卡纳诗人游历地狱、炼狱与天堂的故事。


Take a fairy tale, like Little Red Riding Hood. The text starts from a given set of characters and situations - a little girl, a mother, a grandmother, a wolf, a wood - and through a series of finite steps arrives at a solution. Certainly, you can read the fairy tale as an allegory and attribute different moral meanings to the events and to the actions of the characters, but you cannot transform Little Red Riding Hood into Cinderella. Finnegan's Wake is certainly open to many interpretations, but it is certain that it will never provide you with a demonstration of Fermat's last theorem, or with the complete bibliography of Woody Allen. This seems trivial, but the radical mistake of many deconstructionists was to believe that you can do anything you want with a text. This is thoroughly false.  
以童话《小红帽》为例。文本始于一组既定角色与情境——小女孩、母亲、祖母、狼、森林——并通过一系列有限步骤抵达结局。你固然可将童话读作寓言，为事件与角色行为赋予不同道德寓意，但无法将《小红帽》变为《灰姑娘》。《芬尼根的守灵夜》当然允许多元解读，但它绝不可能为你证明费马大定理，或提供伍迪·艾伦的完整生平。这看似不言而喻，但许多解构主义者的根本错误，在于相信文本可任由人随意改造。这是彻底谬误。


Now suppose that a finite and limited text is organised hypertextually by many links connecting given words with other words. In a dictionary or an encyclopaedia the word wolf is potentially connected to every other word that makes up part of its possible definition or description (wolf is connected to animal, to mammal, to ferocity, to legs, to fur, to eyes, to woods, to the names of the countries in which wolves exist, etc.). In Little Red Riding Hood, the wolf can be connected only with the textual sections in which it shows up or in which it is explicitly evoked. The series of possible links is finite and limited. How can hypertextual strategies be used to "open” up a finite and limited text?  
现在假设一个有限文本通过超链接将特定词语与其他词语相连。在词典或百科全书中，"狼"一词潜在地关联着构成其定义或描述的所有词汇（狼关联到动物、哺乳动物、凶残、四肢、皮毛、眼睛、森林、狼栖息的国家名称等）。而在《小红帽》里，狼仅能关联到文本中它出场或被明确提及的段落。可能的链接序列是有限且受约束的。如何用超文本策略来"打开"一个有限文本？


 The first possibility is to make the text physically unlimited, in the sense that a story can be enriched by the successive contributions of different authors and in a double sense, let us say either two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally. By this I mean that given, for instance, Little Red Riding Hood, the first author proposes a starting situation (the girl enters the wood) and different contributors can then develop the story one after the other, for example, by having the girl meet not the wolf but Ali Baba, by having both enter an enchanted castle, having a confrontation with a magic crocodile, and so on, so that the story can continue for years. But the text can also be infinite in the sense that at every narrative disjunction, for instance, when the girl enters the wood, many authors can make many different choices. For one author, the girl may meet Pinocchio, for another she may be transformed into a swan, or enter the Pyramids and discover the treasure of the son of Tutankhamen.  
第一种可能是使文本在物理层面上无限延伸：即一个故事可通过不同作者的持续贡献而丰富，这种丰富可以是二维或三维的。例如，《小红帽》中，第一位作者设定初始情境（女孩进入森林），后续创作者可接力发展情节：让女孩遇见阿里巴巴而非狼；让两者进入魔法城堡，与魔法鳄鱼对决……如此故事可延续多年。文本亦可在另一种意义上无限：在每个叙事分岔点（如女孩进入森林时），多位作者可做出不同选择——她可能遇见匹诺曹，或被变成天鹅，或进入金字塔发现图坦卡蒙之子的宝藏。


This is today possible, and you can find on the net some interesting examples of such literary games.  
这在今天已成为可能，网络中可找到此类文学游戏的有趣案例。


Yet, there is a difference between implementing the activity of producing infinite and unlimited texts and the existence of already produced texts, which can perhaps be interpreted in infinite ways but are physically limited. In our same contemporary culture we accept and evaluate, according to different standards, both a new performance of Beethoven's Fifth and a new Jam Session on the Basin Street theme. In this sense, I do not see how the fascinating game of producing collective, infinite stories through the net can deprive us of authorial literature and art in general. Rather, we are marching towards a more liberated society in which free creativity will coexist with the interpretation of already written texts. I like this. But we cannot say that we have substituted an old thing with a new one. We have both.  
然而，创作无限文本的活动与已完成的文本存在本质区别：后者或许能被无限解读，但其物理形态是有限的。在当代文化中，我们以不同标准欣赏贝多芬《第五交响曲》的新演绎，也评价以 Basin Street 为主题的新即兴爵士演出。同理，通过网络创作集体无限故事的游戏，并不会取代传统的作者文学与艺术。相反，我们正迈向一个更自由的社会，自由创作将与经典文本的阐释共存。这令我欣喜。但我们不能说新事物取代了旧事物——二者将并存。


All these physically moveable texts give an impression of absolute freedom on the part of the reader, but this is only an impression, an illusion of freedom. The machinery that allows one to produce an infinite text with a finite number of elements has existed for millennia, and this is the alphabet. Using an alphabet with a limited number of letters one can produce billions of texts, and this is exactly what has been done from Homer to the present days. In contrast, a stimulus-text that provides us not with letters, or words, but with pre-established sequences of words, or of pages, does not set us free to invent anything we want. We are only free to move pre-established textual chunks in a reasonably high number of ways. A Calder mobile is fascinating not because it produces an infinite number of possible movements but because we admire in it the iron-like rule imposed by the artist, because the mobile moves only in the ways Calder wanted it to move.  
所有这类物理形态可变的文本，营造出读者享有绝对自由的幻象。但那只是一种错觉。用有限元素生成无限文本的机制已存在数千年——那就是字母表。用有限字母可创作无数文本，从荷马史诗至今皆然。反之，若一个文本提供的不是字母或单词，而是预先设定的词句或篇章序列，则我们并无自由创造的空间，仅能在有限范围内重组既定文本片段。考尔德的动态雕塑之所以迷人，非因它能产生无限运动轨迹，而是因我们从中窥见艺术家赋予的、如铁律般的精密规则——雕塑仅以考尔德预设的方式运动。


At the last borderline of free textuality there can be a text that starts as a closed one, let us say, Little Red Riding Hood or The Arabian Nights, and that I, the reader, can modify according to my inclinations, thus elaborating a second text, which is no longer the same as the original one, whose author is myself, even though the affirmation of my authorship is a weapon against the concept of definite authorship. The net is open to such experiments, and most of them can be beautiful and rewarding. Nothing forbids one writing a story where Little Red Riding Hood devours the wolf. Nothing forbids us from putting together different stories in a sort of narrative patchwork. But this has nothing to do with the real function and with the profound charms of books.  
自由文本性的边界处，可能存在这样的文本：它起初是封闭的（如《小红帽》或《一千零一夜》），而我作为读者可按喜好修改，创作出第二个文本。这新文本已不同于原作，作者是我自己——尽管这种"作者声明"本身是对确定作者概念的挑战。网络为此类实验敞开大门，其中多数作品可能精彩而富有价值。无人禁止重写小红帽吞掉狼的故事，亦无人禁止将不同故事拼合成叙事百衲被。但这与书籍的真正功能及深层魅力无关。


A book offers us a text which, while being open to multiple interpretations, us something that cannot be modified. Suppose you are reading Tolstoy's War and Peace: You desperately wish that Natasha will not accept the courtship of that miserable scoundrel Anatolij; you desperately wish that the marvellous person who is Prince Andrej will not die, and that he and Natasha will live together forever. If you had War and Peace on a hypertextual and interactive CD-ROM, you could rewrite your own story according to your desires; you could invent innumerable "War and Peace"., where Pierre Besuchov succeeds in killing Napoleon, or, according to your preference, Napoleon definitely defeats General Kutusov. What freedom, what excitement! Every Bouvard or Pécuchet could become a Flaubert!  
书籍提供给我们一种文本：它允许多重阐释，却不容修改。假设你正在读托尔斯泰的《战争与和平》：你强烈渴望娜塔莎不接受卑鄙之徒阿纳托利的追求；你恳求安德烈公爵不要死去，愿他与娜塔莎长相厮守。若你拥有《战争与和平》的超文本互动光盘，便可按意愿重写故事，创作无数版本——让皮埃尔·别祖霍夫成功刺杀拿破仑，或让拿破仑彻底击败库图佐夫将军。何等自由！何等激动！每个布瓦尔或佩库歇都可成为福楼拜！


Alas, with an already written book, whose fate is determined by cruel, authorial decision, we cannot do this. We are obliged to accept fate and to realise that we are unable to change destiny. A hypertextual and interactive novel allows us to practice freedom and creativity, and I hope that such inventive activity will be implemented in the schools of the future. But the already and definitely written novel War and Peace does not confront us with the unlimited possibilities of our imagination, but with the severe laws governing life and death.  
然而，面对已写定的书籍——其命运由作者冷酷决断所铸——我们无能为力。我们必须接受宿命，认清自己无力更改结局。超文本互动小说让我们实践自由与创意，我期待这类创造活动在未来教育中普及。但早已完成的《战争与和平》并未展现想象力的无限可能，而是让我们直面生死铁律的严酷。
